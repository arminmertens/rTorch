Description: 'R' implementation and interface of the Machine Learning platform 
    'PyTorch' <https://pytorch.org/> developed in 'Python'. It requires a 'conda'
    environment with 'torch' and 'torchvision' to provide 'PyTorch' functions, 
    methods and classes. The key object in 'PyTorch' is the tensor which is in
    essence a multidimensional array. These tensors are fairly flexible to perform
    calculations in CPUs as well as 'GPUs' to accelerate the process.
