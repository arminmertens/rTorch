## PyTorch installation

### Installing Python and PyTorch
Although, Python and PyTorch can be installed directly from the R console, before start running `rTorch`, I would recommend installing **PyTorch** in a new Python or Python-Anaconda environment, and testing if it's working alright first. The advantage of doing it this way is that you define the base Python or Anaconda version to install.

If you opt to install _PyTorch_ from _R_, `rTorch` has functions that could help you install _PyTorch_ from the _R_ console. 

#### Manual install of _PyTorch_ in a _conda_ environment

If you prefer do it manually, use this example:

1. Create a conda environment with `conda create -n my-torch python=3.7 -y`

2. Activate the new environment with `conda activate my-torch`

3. Inside the new environment, install _PyTorch_ and related packages with:  

`conda install python=3.6 pytorch torchvision matplotlib pandas -c pytorch`

> Note: If you you don't specify a version, `conda` will install the latest _PyTorch_. As of this writing (August-September 2020), the latest _PyTorch_ version is 1.6.

Alternatively, you could create and install a *conda* environment a specific PyTorch version with:

`conda create -n my-torch python=3.6 pytorch=1.3 torchvision matplotlib pandas -c pytorch -y`

`conda` will resolve the dependencies and versions of the other packages automatically, or let you know your options.

**Note.** `matplotlib` and `pandas` are not really necessary, but I was asked if `matplotlib` or `pandas` would work in PyTorch. Then, I decided to put them for testing and experimentation. They both work.

## Automatic Python detection 
In rTorch there is an automatic detection of Python built in in the package that will ask you to install `Miniconda` first if you don't have any Python installed in your machine. For instance, in `MacOS`, Miniconda will be installed under `PREFIX=/Users/user_name/Library/r-miniconda`.

After *Miniconda* is installed, you could proceed to install the flavor or *PyTorch* you wamt, and the packages you want, with a command like this:


```
rTorch:::install_conda(package="pytorch=1.4", envname="r-torch", conda="auto", conda_python_version = "3.6", pip=FALSE, channel="pytorch", extra_packages=c("torchvision", "cpuonly", "matplotlib", "pandas"))
```
